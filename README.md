# BeagleBone Black Monitoring Services

Given the fact that the Controls Group will have more than 600 BeagleBone hosts acting as IOC controllers in Sirius, a way of monitoring the ones that will eventually show some fault is vey important. We propose therefore a client-server archicteture in which each host pings a server every 1 second to signalize it is alive. The server holds all the information about all hosts that are currently pinging it and provides a TCP socket interface to manage and monitor them. Additionally, a Qt5 GUI is made available to manage the hosts.

## Server

The server keeps a list of all hosts connected to the Controls Group's network. Move to the `server/` directory and execute `./run.sh`.


An `SFTF server is running on PORT 1026`, this service is used to provide the projects defined on the types fields. Clients are only able to retrive data from 
the FTP. The server application is responsable to to keep the data up-to-date and fetch is to its clients.

A `web interface is present on PORT 4850`. Flask is the framework of choice for development and Waitress as the WSGI server.

Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. 

Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Python standard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 2.7+ and Python 3.3+. It is also known to run on PyPy 1.6.0+ on UNIX. It supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

## Qt5 Graphical Interface

A Qt5 interface to manage types and nodes. It connects to the server through a TCP socket and sends requests according to the user actions. Move to `client/qt` and run `run.sh`.

## Daemon client

This program should be executed in the host that needs to be monitored. It pings the server every 1 second. It can also receive commands that should run in the host. Execute `run.sh` in `daemon/` folder.

## Docker

To launch the server application on swarm enter the directory `docker/swarm/ ` and run `sudo docker stack deploy -c docker-swarm.yml bbb-daemon`. To remove the containers `sudo docker stack rm bbb-daemon`.

### Configuration files

Each BBB uses basically two kinds of information during boot:

- Its pin configuration, which is defined in a `*.dtbo`.
- The scripts that should be executed. They are launched from a systemd service, called `rc-local.service` . This service uses the command defined in another file, `rc.local`. Therefore, `rc.local` must be updated depending on the function that the host will perform.

Furthermore, we added two more parameters:

- The PV prefix that the IOC running in the BBB will use to create the variables.
- A type parameter to identify the board that the BBB is connected to and the project that should be synchronized with.
